-- | using Int's is wrong, it's overkill like using complex numbers.
--   since "sets" is a natural logical concept, we need a data structure for
--   that, namely UInt. or should we use Peano numbers? 
--   the natural numbers \mathbf{N} is the structure "sets of finite size"
--   the integer numbers \mathbf{Z} is the structure "steps in direction"
type UInt = Word
